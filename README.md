# AIGF Certification Pipeline

An open source, end-to-end certification pipeline that transforms [FINOS AI Governance Framework (AIGF)](https://www.finos.org/ai-governance) guidance into discrete, machine-configurable controls with predefined success criteria and compliance enforcement techniques.

## Problem

Organizations adopting FINOS frameworks face three key challenges:

1. **Generalized guidance** -- AIGF mitigations provide valuable direction but lack the structured, binary mandates needed for automated implementation.
2. **No defined success criteria** -- Without machine-readable control definitions, pathways for both adoption and validation remain ambiguous.
3. **No post-deployment enforcement** -- There is no open source tooling for enforcing continued compliance at runtime after systems are deployed.

## Solution

This project establishes FINOS's first certification pipeline by extending [CALM](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code) bidirectionally -- formalizing AIGF guidance upstream through atomization and enforcing execution-dependent controls downstream through runtime policy evaluation.

**Desired outcome:** Each FINOS policy (e.g. AIGF) has a companion playbook with universally identifiable controls, predefined success criteria, and compliance enforcement techniques.

## Pipeline Overview

The certification pipeline transforms AIGF guidance into enforceable controls through three stages:

```
                                        ┌─────────────────┐
                                   ┌───>│  Architectural  │───> CALM
                                   │    │    Controls     │
┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────┐   │    ├─────────────────┤

                                   └───>│    Controls     │
                                        └─────────────────┘
```

### Step 1: Atomize Policy

Extract guidance from AIGF's 23 mitigations and convert it into individual controls with binary mandates. Each control defines:

- **Responsible party** (e.g. system owners, system owners using RAG)
- **Obligation type** (must or may)
- **Binary or near-binary mandate**

Controls are categorized by type:

| Category | ~Share | Description | Modeled In |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Architectural** | ~50% | Infrastructure/topology decisions (e.g. data segmentation, encryption standards, isolated environments) | CALM |
| **Runtime** | ~25% | Per-request enforcement (e.g. output filtering, sensitive data detection, context-aware authorization) | CALM + Cupcake |
| **Procedural** | ~25% | Periodic audits and governance processes (e.g. data filtering audits, incident feedback loops) | CALM + EQTY Lab |

### Step 2: Model as CALM-Format Controls

Populate control-specific attributes in [CALM](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code) format:

- Control ID, name, and description
- Required evidence and enforcement method
- Binary, control-specific requirements
- (Optional) References to related AIGF mitigation categories

**Example** -- an architectural control for encryption at rest (P14-001):

```json
{
  "control-id": "P14-001",
  "name": "Establishing Standards for Encrypting Data at Rest",
  "description": "System owners must establish clear organizational policies...",
  "approvedAlgorithms": ["AES-256", "AES-192", "AES-128-GCM"],
  "minimumKeyLength": 256,
  "modeOfOperation": "GCM",
  "keyManagementSystem": "AWS KMS",
  "keyRotationPolicy": "90-days"
}
```

### Step 3: Model as Runtime Enforcement Rules (Cupcake)

Translate execution-dependent controls into [OPA/Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) policies that evaluate inputs, outputs, or agent actions at runtime. Define decision logic (allow, block, warn) applied by the [Cupcake](https://github.com/eqtylab/cupcake) enforcement layer.

**Only runtime controls flow through both CALM and Cupcake.** Architectural controls are defined in CALM alone. Procedural controls are defined in CALM and monitored via external tooling.

## Aligned FINOS Initiatives

This project leverages and complements several existing FINOS work streams pushing towards automated, machine-readable compliance:

| Project | Role in Pipeline |
|---|---|
| [AI Governance Framework (AIGF)](https://www.finos.org/ai-governance) | Source framework -- risk catalogue with 23 mitigations |
| [CALM (Common Architecture Language Model)](https://github.com/finos/architecture-as-code) | Schema for structuring controls in a consistent, machine-configurable format |
| [AI Reference Architecture Library](https://github.com/finos-labs/ai-reference-architecture-library) | FSI-specific reference architectures with threat models -- taxonomy for specific use cases |
| [Gemara](https://github.com/finos/gemara) | GRC Engineering Model for converting written governance controls into machine-readable, automated policy rules |
| [AI Evals Framework](https://www.finos.org/ai-strategic-initiative) | Taxonomy for AI evaluations in finance -- defining evals for specific use cases |

## Open Source vs. Commercial Certification

This project focuses on the **open source configuration layer**:

**Can:**
- Validate that controls are correctly defined and modeled in CALM and Cupcake
- Monitor that a system's policy logic behaves correctly when passed through open-source enforcement engines

**Cannot:**
- Produce tamper-evident proof that enforcement occurred consistently in production
- Guarantee that runtime controls were applied on every execution without gaps

The complementary **commercial verification layer** (e.g. [EQTY Lab](https://www.eqtylab.io/) Governance Studio) can provide tamper-proof evidence, continuous monitoring, audit-ready reports, and hardware-backed attestations for organizations requiring production-grade certification.

## Roadmap

1. **Atomize AIGF mitigations** -- Extract and categorize controls from all 23 AIGF mitigations into architectural, runtime, and procedural types
2. **Model controls in CALM** -- Define CALM-format schemas with control-specific requirements and evidence definitions
3. **Implement Rego policies** -- Translate runtime controls into OPA/Rego policies for Cupcake enforcement
4. **Validate end-to-end pipeline** -- Demonstrate full certification flow from AIGF guidance through CALM definition to runtime enforcement
5. **Expand to additional FINOS frameworks** -- Generalize the pipeline to support certification against other FINOS policies beyond AIGF
